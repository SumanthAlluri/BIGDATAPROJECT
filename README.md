# Communication Plan:
We are communicating with the teammates through email, slack and decided to connect every weekend through zoom calls.

# Business Problem or Opportunity:
The dataset consists of yellow and green taxi trip records which include the fields such as pick-up and drop-off dates/times of the passengers, pick-up and drop-off locations, trip distances, fares of the rides, rate types, fare types, payment types, and driver-reported passenger counts. This dataset is collected and provided by to the NYC taxi and limousine commission. For FHV (For-Hire Vehicle) trip records data is collected related to the license number, pick-up date, time, and location.
However, there is inconsistency in the data which needs to be pre-processed in order to derive useful insights and patterns to improve the service for the passengers. For example increasing the number of taxiâ€™s in particular which has most trips recorded.

# Research Objectives:
We can predict the time at which the most number of trips take place, the most used payment type by the customers, and also most used route by the passengers so that we can increase the services for that particular route using the dataset.
